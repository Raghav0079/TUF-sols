This is the driver code that will execute and demonstrate the functionality of your abstract class `PaymentGateway` 
and the derived classes `CreditCardPayment` and `UPIPayment`.

If the payment method is credit card:
    It creates the object of class `CreditCardPayment`.
    It then calls the `processPayment` method of the `CreditCardPayment` class 
    and prints the corresponding text inside the method.

If the payment method is UPI:
    It creates the object of class `UPIPayment`.
    It then calls the `processPayment` method of the `UPIPayment` class 
    and prints the corresponding text inside the method.


int main() {
    vector<string> paymentMethods;
    vector<double> amounts;

    for (int j = 0; j < paymentMethods.size(); j++) {
        PaymentGateway* payment = nullptr;

        string method = paymentMethods[j];
        transform(method.begin(), method.end(), method.begin(), ::tolower);

        if (method == "credit") {
            payment = new CreditCardPayment();
        } else if (method == "upi") {
            payment = new UPIPayment();
        }

        payment->processPayment(amounts[j]);
        delete payment;
    }

    return 0;
